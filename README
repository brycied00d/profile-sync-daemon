Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny shell script designed to manage your browser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically sync it back to your physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and synchronization. The daemon auto-detects which browser(s) the specified user(s) are running and automatically manages them.
